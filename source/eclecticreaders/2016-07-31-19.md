pubDate: "2016-07-31"
description: "Tara and Meredith fly across the pond to see Harry Potter and The Cursed Child at the Palace Theatre and are back to give us their reactions and all the Cursed Child information you could want. We fangirl out about all of the cool things we saw and experienced during the play, get Molly and Ginny confused (sorry Ginny), and while the first few minutes are general reactions, we do delve into the plot in the episode, so, be forewarned: SPOILERS AHEAD!"
