pubDate: "2016-08-15"
description: "Susan is super excited about new kids’ books, while we prescribe reading with a singalong to help Tara resist a reading slump.  We weigh binge-reading versus serialized reading, and find out that Mere might just become a serial reader. On the other hand, Jeannette just wants to binge read all the series. All of them. We then discuss at length Patrick Rothfuss’s lengthy 'The Name of the Wind,' and kindly request more answers and more 'Spice' in Kvothe’s life."
