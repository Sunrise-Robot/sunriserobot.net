description: "In this final episode with Bruce, we discuss the rise of the paperback, the heyday of 20th century publishing, science fiction’s origins in magazines, and the meaning of books and reading.  Also, some good old fashioned speculation on the future of reading and literacy: Why haven’t ebooks overtaken physical books in popularity? How is social media affecting literacy? And are writers being reduced to simple soundbites and Good Reads quote pages and bad graphic design posters?"
