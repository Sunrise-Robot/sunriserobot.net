description: "Computers in the 50s and 60s were glorified calculators, existing as giant mainframes in large rooms, before the personal computer revolutions of the 70s and 80s. See how these dramatic changes affected the lives of normal citizens through the lens of an english professor at a university who brought computers to the classroom in the early 80s and sent his first email in 1983, travelled to Africa with a laptop in the 90s, and still plays with the latest gadgets to this day."
