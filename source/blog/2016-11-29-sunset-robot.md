To our beloved listeners,

It is with heavy hearts we announce that we will be closing down Sunrise Robot at the end of 2016.

To cut to the chase: _it's Mike's fault!_ He's decided he wants to take a step away from podcasting to pursue some new things. Upon hearing this news and considering the options, Lyons and Matt didn't feel it was right for Flipping Tables or Bits & Pieces to go on without him, neither as solo shows nor with a new co-host.

At the end of this year, **Sunrise Robot will be transformed into an archive to live on as a monument to all the proud work we've done together.** All the episodes released on the network will continue to be freely available at sunriserobot.net.

What about the other shows? Raconteur Denver, **Likely Story, and Eclectic Readers Book Club will continue to release new shows**, but not on the Sunrise Robot network. Subscribe to those shows to make the transition from here to there completely seamless and automatic, or follow the hosts on Twitter to get more info.

The Pseudo Show has been on hiatus for awhile, and Some Pulp concluded with the passing of host Bruce Edwards, Mike's dad, last year. Both of those shows will be part of the archive.

It's been a wonderful ride and as we say every episode: we love you all so much and we could not have done this without you!

**Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.**

PS> Lyons claims he's not through with podcasting yet. [Follow him on twitter @lyonsinbeta](https://twitter.com/lyonsinbeta) if you want to keep up with future projects.
