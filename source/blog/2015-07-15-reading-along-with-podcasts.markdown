Like books? Of course you do. Like podcasts? _Of course you do._

You might have noticed a new show (our first new show since we launched!) dropped on July 1st called [Eclectic Readers Book Club](/eclecticreaders). If you're clever and [subscribed](pcast://sunriserobot.net/eclecticreaders/feed.xml) or [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/sunriserobot) then you also know [the fifth episode was released today](/eclecticreaders/5)! You may not have heard of a book club podcast before so I'm here to share with you why it's awesome.

**tl;dr** read the book, listen to the podcast, keep the conversation going with the hosts on [Goodreads](/eclecticreaders) and [twitter](/eclecticreaders).

## Your New Favorite Book Club

Book clubs are fun. If you've never been a part of one now you are. Each month [Susan](http://twitter.com/ruri_kaichou), [Jeannette](http://twitter.com/DrJeannette), and [Tara](http://twitter.com/TaraNewman) meet to discuss the month's book and you get all the benefits of meeting with smart friends in a coffee shop while you're really on your commute or doing chores. At the end of each episode and in the show notes you'll find the next book. Read along, discuss on Goodreads and twitter, and subscribe so you get the next episode as soon as it's out!

I'm really excited to bring new voices and a new podcast format to Sunrise Robot. Now go listen and subscribe!

And welcome to the [Eclectic Readers Book Club](/eclecticreaders).
