You like stories, don't you?

We're thrilled to announce that Sunrise Robot is collaborating with [Raconteur Denver](http://raconteurdenver.com)!

Raconteur Denver is a live storytelling event created by Amber Blais, Derrick Mund, and our very own Michael Edwards!

At a Raconteur Denver event, we invite three phenomenal storytellers to come tell their tales at an interesting venue in Denver.

Audience members also have a chance to sign up and tell their own stories!

If you don't live in Colorado, or can't make it out to a live event, then you're in luck! Sunrise Robot is collecting all the best stories and releasing them as a podcast!
