description: "Shelby and Polly are back with Episode 21. Nothing brings the mood down like talking about grief and loss. But don't worry - they get back to discussing bad tv quickly. For example the Bastard Executioner, which has already been cancelled. Also: The Walking Dead, VEEP, and Life in Pieces are winning the world."
