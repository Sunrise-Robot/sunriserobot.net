description: "Polly is back and she's married! In her absence, Shelby finished watching True Blood. Now, Shelby and Polly are reunited for a recap of Polly's wedding before they dig into the insane amount of Fall TV they are each watching. Some good (Life in Pieces and Quantico), some bad (Bastard Executioner and Minority Report), and everything in between. At one point in the recording, Polly sounds like a robot for no reason."
