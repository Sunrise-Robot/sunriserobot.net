description: "In early 2014, we started a podcast called Flipping Tables. Every week we released a new episode through sickness, blizzards, and whatever else life sent our way. After nearly a year of non-stop episodes, we realized this was no longer just a hobby, but something we wanted to grow beyond one show. With Michael's killer designs and Lyons hacking away in vim we built a sleek website and launched Sunrise Robot as a whole network of shows for technologists, gamers, artists and cultural enthusiasts."
